# Objective

League Hub is an online resource for people around the world to easily access and view information about the popular game League of Legends. In it's current iteration, users can search, filter and view Champions associated with the game and consume information about that champion. A user will be able to upvote a champion if they wish to do so and also leave a comment about that champion for everyone to see. Staff members of the League Hub will be responsible for content control and will be able to create, edit and delete champions as well as having the ability to delete inappropriate comments by users. Overall, the goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive and accessible source of information for League of Legends enthusiasts.
